    <p>I am fluent in <span class="bold">English</span>,<span class="bold">Kiswahili</span> and <span class="bold">French</span>.I decided to take a class on programming to gain the skill and also due to the fact that I enjoy a good challenge.I chose the image of a lotus flower because it represents rising above challenges and this reminds me to always be resilient.</p>
