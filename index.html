    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am 18years old.I completed my high school education in 2016 at Moi High School-Kabarak which is located in Nakuru.I live with my parents and brother in Imara Daima Estate.I love reading books written by African authors;my favourite author is Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.I also enjoy watching movies especially those created by <em>Marvel</em>.I love hip-hop music and my favourite artists are:
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Kendrick Lamar</strong></li>
        <li><strong>J Cole</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Drake</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Bryson Tiller</strong></li>
      </ol>
    <p>I am fluent in <span class="bold">English</span>,<span class="bold">Kiswahili</span> and <span class="bold">French</span>.I decided to take a class on programming to gain the skill and also due to the fact that I enjoy a good challenge.I chose the image of a lotus flower because it represents rising above challenges and this reminds me to always be resilient.</p>
